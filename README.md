Overview
This repository hosts two powerful tools designed to simplify and enhance your workflows:
1): Image Processing Toolbox – A comprehensive suite of image manipulation and transformation features.
2): Face Recognition Tool – A state-of-the-art face recognition system leveraging One-Shot Learning.
Features
Image Processing Toolbox
File Operations
Open Image: Load an image from your computer for editing and processing.
Save Image: Save the edited image in your preferred format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
Save Compressed: Save images with adjustable compression levels for optimized storage.
Basic Transformations
Apply Grayscale: Convert images to black and white.
Undo/Redo: Easily revert or reapply the last changes.
Reset Image: Return the image to its original state.
Resize Image: Adjust dimensions with optional aspect ratio maintenance.
Crop Image: Trim the image by specifying a centered crop area.
Flip Image: Flip horizontally, vertically, or both.
Rotate Image: Rotate by a specified angle.
Advanced Transformations
Skew Image: Distort the image along the X and Y axes.
Histogram Equalization: Enhance image contrast for improved visibility.
Negative Image: Invert image colors for a dramatic effect.
Log Transformation: Enhance dark areas in low-contrast images.
Gamma Correction: Brighten or darken images.
Gray Level and Bit Plane Slicing: Highlight specific intensity levels for high contrast.
Filters
Median Filter: Reduce noise while preserving edges.
Gaussian Filter: Apply a Gaussian blur for smoothness.
Circular and Averaging Filters: Enhance image features or smooth pixel values.
Laplacian and Sobel Filters: Detect edges with precision.
Low/High Pass Filters (Frequency Domain): Smoothen or enhance image details.
Noise Addition
Salt and Pepper Noise: Simulate random pixel noise.
Gaussian Noise: Add realistic low-light noise.
Edge Detection and Thresholding
Edge Detection: Highlight significant changes using Canny's algorithm.
Thresholding: Simplify images to black and white based on intensity.
Special Effects
Smooth and Sharpen: Enhance edges while maintaining clarity.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Extract text from images using OCR technology. The extracted text can be viewed, copied, or saved as a .txt file.

Face Recognition Tool
Overview
This tool uses One-Shot Learning for face recognition, enabling accurate identification even with minimal training data. It’s ideal for scenarios where gathering large datasets is impractical.

Features
Face Detection: Identify and isolate faces in an image or video stream.
One-Shot Learning: Train the system to recognize new faces with just one example.
High Accuracy: Leverages deep learning techniques to achieve reliable results.
Live Recognition: Perform real-time face recognition on a video feed.
